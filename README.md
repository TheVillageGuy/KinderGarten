Kinder Garten mod for RimWorld

All weapons have 0 power. In this context, traps and turrets are not weapons.
Weapon textures/descriptions/sounds have been altered or replaced to make them look like toys.
Some weapons can still start fires and can still explode when burning.

This requires a completely different style of playing rimworld as only melee fighting has effect. Turrets are not modified so there is at least a little challenge when attacking enemy bases. Decide for yourself if you want to use them, just like traps, depending on how difficult you want the game to be. 

This mod works, but the visuals/sounds/texts are not perfect, I have come to the point where I think putting additional work into it will not merit much improvements.

It should be savegame compatible, add and remove. If not let me know.
